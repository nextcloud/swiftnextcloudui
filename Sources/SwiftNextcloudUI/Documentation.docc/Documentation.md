# ``SwiftNextcloudUI``

A multi-platform package to provide common user interface elements of apps by Nextcloud written in SwiftUI.

## Overview

Key traits of this package:

- **Swift 6.1**. Latest language features independent from the consuming projects.
- **Multiplatform**. With iOS and iPad OS being targeted primarily, macOS is supported to and checked for compatibility and appearance.
- **Strict concurrency checks enabled**. Avoiding technical debt from the start as far as possible.
- **Built for the future**. Minimum requirements are iOS 17 and macOS 15. This enables the use of modern APIs which improve code and work significantly. [Nextcloud Notes](http://github.com/nextcloud/notes-ios) is the first app to adopt this and already requires iOS 17 by itself. macOS support is not planned officially but maintained as much as possible to keep the door open.
- **SwiftLint**. SwiftLint is used as a build tool plugin to enforce certain code style and quality.
- **Unit tests**. Existing projects did lack test coverage so these are considered where possible.
- **Separation of concerns**. This is a user interface package. It does not implement business logic. It does not even depend on [NextcloudKit](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudkit). The delegate pattern and closures are used instead to leave business logic implementation to consumers of this library.
- **String catalogs**. The user interface naturally contains localizable strings. To leverage latest technologies and learnings, this package is using [string catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) to _automatically on build_ update all the localizations in a single resource, including pluralization.
- **Localization**. The localizable texts in the user interface provided by this package are maintained on [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/swiftnextcloudui/).
